# Opioid Tolerance Analysis Project - Context & Progress

## Project Overview
Statistical analysis web application for perioperative opioid consumption in joint replacement surgery patients. Compares opioid-tolerant vs opioid-naive patients using advanced statistical methods.

## Current Files
- `stats.html` - Main analysis interface with Plotly visualizations
- CSV data: `Opioid tolerance in total hip and total knee replacement patients at North Canberra Hospital -6-7-25(CollectedData) (6).csv`

## Data Structure Key Fields
- **Include in stats?** - "yes"/"no" - CRITICAL: Must be filtered (currently not implemented!)
- **Patient DOB** - For age calculations 
- **Date of Operation** - For age at surgery
- **Anaesthetic block used** - Various block types/combinations
- **Opioids pre-op** - Type and dose for baseline calculations
- **oral morphine equivalent (mg)** - Pre-op tolerance threshold (â‰¥10mg = tolerant)
- **Oral morphine equivalents (0-24h/24-48h/48-72h post-op)** - Time-period consumption
- **Other analgesics used** - Contains anti-inflammatory medication info
- **Pain scores** - Format "D1 post-op X/10" 
- **Time to discharge** - Need to handle rehab transfers specially

## Statistical Methods
- Mann-Whitney U test (non-parametric, robust for skewed data)
- Cohen's d effect sizes with interpretation
- 95% Confidence intervals
- Correlation analysis with linear regression
- ROC curve analysis for threshold optimization

## Implementation Phases

### PHASE 1: Fix Core Data Processing âœ… STARTED
**CRITICAL BUG**: stats.html currently processes ALL patients, ignoring "Include in stats?" column
- Must add filtering: `row['Include in stats?'] === 'yes'`
- Update processData() function line 417

### PHASE 2: Expand Data Parsing (PENDING)
New fields to extract:
- Patient age from DOB and operation date
- Anaesthetic block categories (spinal/intrathecal/regional)
- Anti-inflammatory usage (celecoxib, meloxicam, parecoxib, etc.)
- Day 1 pain scores (parse "D1 post-op X/10" format)
- Time to discharge (handle rehab specially)

### PHASE 3: New Statistical Analyses (PENDING)
1. **Baseline-adjusted consumption** - Subtract pre-op from each time period
2. **Block type comparisons** - Group by anaesthetic technique
3. **Age-opioid correlation** - Scatter plots with age groups
4. **Anti-inflammatory impact** - Users vs non-users comparison
5. **Pain score analysis** - Day 1 scores between groups
6. **Discharge analysis** - Time to discharge with rehab handling

### PHASE 4: New Visualizations (PENDING)
- Multi-panel dashboards
- Age vs consumption scatter plots
- Block type comparison charts
- Pain score distributions
- Interactive filtering capabilities

### PHASE 5: Enhanced Statistics (PENDING)
- Statistical significance for all new comparisons
- Multiple comparison corrections where needed
- Enhanced interpretation guides

## Technical Notes
- Uses Papa Parse for CSV processing
- Plotly.js for interactive visualizations
- Self-contained HTML with embedded data export capability
- Responsive design with clinical interpretation guides

## Progress Status
- Phase 1: âœ… COMPLETE (Critical "Include in stats?" filtering implemented)
- Phase 2: âœ… COMPLETE (All data parsing functions implemented)
- Phase 3: âœ… COMPLETE (All new statistical analyses implemented)
- Phase 4: âœ… COMPLETE (All new visualizations implemented)
- Phase 5: âœ… COMPLETE (Statistical significance testing implemented)

## Implementation Details - COMPLETED

### âœ… Phase 1: Fixed Critical Data Processing

- Now properly filters data with `row['Include in stats?'].toLowerCase().trim() === 'yes'`
- Added robust data parsing for all new fields

### âœ… Phase 2: Data Parsing Functions Implemented
- `calculateAgeAtSurgery()` - Handles multiple date formats (DD/MM/YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY)
- `parseAnaestheticBlocks()` - Detects spinal, intrathecal, regional block combinations
- `parseAntiInflammatoryUsage()` - Identifies 7 common anti-inflammatory medications
- `parsePainScore()` - Extracts Day 1 pain scores from various text formats
- `parseDischargeTime()` - Parses discharge days and identifies rehab transfers

### âœ… Phase 3: New Statistical Analyses
1. **Baseline-adjusted consumption** - Subtracts pre-op OME from each period
2. **Age-opioid correlation** - Scatter plots with regression lines by tolerance group
3. **Block type comparisons** - 6 categories: Spinal Only, Spinal+Intrathecal, etc.
4. **Anti-inflammatory impact** - 4-way comparison: Tolerant/Naive Â± Anti-inflammatory
5. **Pain score analysis** - Day 1 pain scores between groups with box plots
6. **Discharge analysis** - Length of stay excluding rehab, with rehab rates calculated

### âœ… Phase 4: New Visualizations Implemented
- `createAgeCorrelationChart()` - Age vs consumption with separate regression lines
- `createBaselineAdjustedChart()` - Consumption above baseline by time period  
- `createBlockTypeChart()` - Color-coded bar chart by anaesthetic technique
- `createAntiInflammatoryChart()` - 4-group comparison bar chart
- `createPainScoreChart()` - Box plots comparing Day 1 pain scores
- `createDischargeChart()` - Length of stay with rehab rate annotations
- All charts include detailed clinical interpretation guides

### âœ… Phase 5: Enhanced Statistics
- **Mann-Whitney U tests** for all new group comparisons
- **Linear regression** with correlation coefficients for age analysis
- **Effect size calculations** integrated into summary tables
- **Clinical interpretation logic** for all findings
- **Automated summary generation** with statistical significance indicators
